## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g git-ai-tool

# Set required environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token" # Optional, for PR detection
```

## Usage

Navigate to any Git repository and run:

```bash
git-ai-tool commit
```

The interactive terminal UI will guide you through:

1. Reviewing staged and unstaged changes
2. Staging changes if needed
3. Generating and confirming a commit message
4. Pushing changes to remote
5. Providing a PR URL if applicable

## Requirements

- Node.js 16.0.0 or higher
- Git installed and configured
- OpenAI API key for commit message generation
- GitHub token (optional) for PR detection

## Environment Variables

| Variable         | Required | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes      | Your OpenAI API key for generating commit messages |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`   | No       | GitHub token for detecting existing PRs            |

You can set these in your shell profile or use a tool like `direnv` to manage them per project.
